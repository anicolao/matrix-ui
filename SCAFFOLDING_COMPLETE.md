# Matrix UI - Project Scaffolding Complete 🎉

This repository now contains the complete initial scaffolding for the Matrix UI chat client based on the detailed specifications in README.md and IMPLEMENTATION_SKETCH.md.

## 📋 Scaffolding Overview

### ✅ What's Been Created

**Core Architecture:**
- **Tauri 2.x Application** - Cross-platform desktop app framework
- **Rust Backend** - High-performance native backend with modular design
- **Web Frontend** - Modern HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface
- **Development Workflow** - Complete build and development setup

**Project Structure:**

**Key Features Implemented:**
- 🎨 **Menu Bar Avatar Carousel** - Animated chat avatars with notifications
- 💬 **Chat Window Interface** - Clean, focused messaging interface  
- 🔍 **Ephemeral Chat Switcher** - Keyboard-triggered overlay for room navigation
- 📱 **Responsive Design** - Optimized for desktop workflows
- ⚡ **Demo Functionality** - Working UI with simulated data

### 🛠️ Development Ready

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development mode
npm run dev
# or
cargo tauri dev
```

**Build for Production:**
```bash
npm run build
# or
cargo tauri build
```

### 🎯 Next Implementation Steps

The scaffolding provides a solid foundation for implementing the advanced features described in the specifications:

**Phase 1: Core Integration**
- [ ] Matrix SDK integration (matrix-rust-sdk)
- [ ] Real Matrix homeserver connectivity
- [ ] Room and message synchronization

**Phase 2: System Integration**
- [ ] Global keyboard shortcuts (Caps Lock remapping)
- [ ] Virtual desktop detection and switching
- [ ] System tray integration
- [ ] Cross-platform native APIs

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**
- [ ] Context-aware room filtering
- [ ] Audio notification system
- [ ] Desktop automation
- [ ] Performance optimizations

### 🔧 Technical Architecture

**Backend (Rust):**
- Modular design with separation of concerns
- Async/await support with Tokio
- Cross-platform compatibility layers
- Placeholder structures for Matrix integration

**Frontend (Web):**
- Vanilla JavaScript for simplicity and performance
- CSS animations for smooth UI transitions
- Tauri bridge for backend communication
- Component-based UI architecture

**Configuration:**
- Development and production build profiles
- Platform-specific bundle settings
- Extensible plugin system

### 📚 Documentation

- **DEVELOPMENT.md** - Complete development guide with setup instructions
- **README.md** - Original project specification and design
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SKETCH.md** - Technical implementation details
- Inline code documentation throughout modules

### 🎨 UI Preview

The current implementation includes:
- Dark theme optimized for professional workflows
- Animated avatar carousel in menu bar
- Clean chat interface with message history
- Keyboard-navigable chat switcher overlay
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

### 🚀 Ready for Development

The project is now ready for feature implementation! The scaffolding provides:
- ✅ Compiling Rust/Tauri application
